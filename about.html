          <p>
            The Warriors were founded in 1946 and originally based in Philadelphia. One of the original members of the BAA, the team won the league’s first championship behind the play of future Hall of Fame forward Joe Fulks, the BAA’s inaugural scoring leader. The Warriors lost in the BAA finals the next season, and in 1949 the team became a part of the NBA when the BAA merged with the National Basketball League (NBL). The Warriors finished higher than fourth place in their division just once in their first six seasons in the new league. In 1955–56, however, the Warriors, led by forward Paul Arizin and centre Neil Johnston, posted the best record in the league and captured their first NBA title.

            In 2015 the Warriors faced a relative struggle in the Western Conference play-offs, losing at least one game in each series—which included Golden State overcoming a 3–1 series deficit to the Oklahoma City Thunder in the conference finals—en route to making a return to the NBA finals. There the Warriors were on the other end of a 3–1 series comeback, as the Cleveland Cavaliers stormed their way to three straight victories to win the teams’ finals rematch.

            <h3>The 2018 Finals</h3>
            <p>
              The 2018 NBA Finals was the championship series of the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s 2017–18 season and conclusion of the season's playoffs. In this best-of-seven playoff, the defending NBA champion and Western Conference champion Golden State Warriors swept the Eastern Conference champion Cleveland Cavaliers 4 games to 0. This Finals was the first time in any of North America's four major professional sports leagues that the same two teams met for the championship four years in a row. This was also the first time that a team was swept in the NBA Finals since 2007, in which the Cavaliers were also the losing team. LeBron James, in his eighth consecutive NBA Finals appearance, suffered the second Finals sweeps of his career, having also played in the 2007 NBA Finals. Kevin Durant was named NBA Finals MVP for the second straight year. After his third appearance in the Finals, Durant became the only player to shoot over 50/40/90 for an NBA Finals career under the non-shortened 3-point line.
